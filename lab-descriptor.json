  "introduction": "The Computer Networks Lab provides students with hands-on experience in understanding how data is transmitted, controlled, and managed across communication networks. Through practical experiments, students explore core networking concepts such as error control, flow control, routing, line encoding, network topologies, and security mechanisms. The lab also introduces real-world networking devices, client–server architectures, and packet-switching techniques that form the foundation of modern internet communication. Overall, this lab helps students develop practical skills essential for designing, analyzing, and implementing computer networks",
